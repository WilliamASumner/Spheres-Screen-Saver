# Spheres Screen Saver

## Overview
- I felt like making my own relaxing and colorful screen saver, and here's what I've come up with!

## How to use
1) Open with Xcode and hit build
2) Copy into your ~/Library/Screen Savers directory
3) Enjoy!

## Known Issue(s)
- There's a weird flickering when the colors transitions at point, I think it may be the result of multiple animations conflicting with
each other
